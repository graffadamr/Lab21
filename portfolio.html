    <p>I maintained a blog about my entire experience thruhiking the Appalachian Trail, including what it was like to prepare for it and analysis conducted after finishing. You can read it <a href="http://atearthman.blogspot.com/">here</a>.
    <br><p>As a huge fan of film, I take an active part in an online community of cinephiles who share reviews, lists and challenges with one another. Most of my writing about moves can be found here. <a href="https://letterboxd.com/Linuscaldwell75/">This</a> is my profile.
